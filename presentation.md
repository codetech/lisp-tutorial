## Lisp

- Created by John McCarthy in 1960
- The "list" data structure is used for code AND data
- Developed for artificial intelligence at MIT

- Lisp = "LISt Processing"
- Lisp = "Lost Ina Seaof Parentheses"
- Lisp = "Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parenthesis"

## Qualities

- Functional; that is, "uses functions"
- Code is data
- Recursive
  - recursion preferred to looping
  - the language can be implemented in itself
- Dialects
  - Lisp comes in many similar (yet slightly different) flavors
  - Lisp 1.5, MacLisp, Interlisp
  - Scheme, Common Lisp, Clojure, Emacs Lisp

## Features Pioneered

- Conditionals
- A function type
- Recursion
- Variables as pointers
- Garbage-collection
- Read-evaluate-print loop (REPL)

## Why Learn It?

> "Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will
> have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better
> programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp
> itself a lot."

Functional languages influence modern mainstream languages (Perl, JavaScript,
Python and Ruby all have functional influence).  Can teach you new ways to do
things in your everyday work.

Lisp is a secret weapon.  In the hands of Paul Graham, he grew Viaweb eStore
